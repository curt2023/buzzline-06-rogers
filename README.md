## Task 1. Create and activate a .venv



## Task 2. Start Zookeeper and Kafka (Takes 2 Terminals)

If Zookeeper and Kafka are not already running, you'll need to restart them.
See instructions at [SETUP-KAFKA.md] to:

1. Start Zookeeper Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-7-start-zookeeper-service-terminal-1))
2. Start Kafka Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-8-start-kafka-terminal-2))

## Task 3. Start a New Streaming Application

This will take two more terminals:

1. One to run the producer which writes messages. 
2. Another to run the consumer which reads messages, processes them, and writes them to a data store. 

### Custom Consumer



### Producer (Terminal 3) 

Start the producer to generate the messages. 
The existing producer writes messages to a live data file in the data folder.
If Zookeeper and Kafka services are running, it will try to write them to a Kafka topic as well.
For configuration details, see the .env file. 

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.producer_rogers
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.producer_rogers
```

The producer will still work if Kafka is not available.

### Consumer (Terminal 4) 

Start an associated consumer. 
You have two options. 
1. Start the consumer that reads from the live data file.
2. OR Start the consumer that reads from the Kafka topic.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.kafka_consumer_rogers
OR
py -m consumers.file_consumer_rogers
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.kafka_consumer_case
OR
python3 -m consumers.file_consumer_case
```
